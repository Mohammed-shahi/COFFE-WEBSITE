            Chikmagalur is the region where the Hoysala rulers started and spent the early days of their dynasty.
            According to a legend, it was at Sosevur, now identified with Angadi in Mudigere Taluk that Sala, the
            founder of the Hoysala dynasty,
            killed the legendary tiger, immortalised in the Hoysala crest.
            It is known that Veera Ballala II (1173 – 1220 CE), the great king of Hoysala empire,

            Coffee was introduced into India through the Chikmagalur district when the first coffee crop was grown
            in the <b>baba budan giri range during 1670 AD.</b>
            <b> The saint Baba Budan on his pilgrimage to Mecca travelled through the seaport of Mocha, Yemen where he
                discovered coffee.
                To introduce its taste to India, he wrapped seven coffee beans around his belly and got them out of
                Arabia.
                On his return home, he planted the beans in the hills of Chikmagalur</b>
